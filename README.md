# Steam Deck Customizable Keyboard
A clean, modern, fully‑customizable keyboard theme for the Steam Deck.

This project gives you a simple, structured way to restyle the on‑screen keyboard using CSS Loader. Rounded keys, new palettes, accent colors — everything is controlled through variables and built‑in UI controls.
