# Repo Screens

This folder is **not part of the actual keyboard theme**.

It only contains screenshots used for the main README or for showcasing presets.
Nothing inside this directory is required for the CSS theme itself, and these files will not affect the keyboard styles in any way.

You can safely ignore this folder when using or forking the project — it exists purely for documentation and visual previews.
